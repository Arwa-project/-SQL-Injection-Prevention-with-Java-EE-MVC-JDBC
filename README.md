# SQL Injection Prevention with Java EE  

## Overview  
This project demonstrates the risks of SQL Injection attacks and provides solutions using Java EE and MySQL. The application includes a login functionality implemented in two versions: a vulnerable version and a secure version.

### Features  
#### Vulnerable Implementation  
- Simulates SQL Injection vulnerabilities with examples:  
  - Boolean-based Injection  
  - Union-based Injection  
  - Time-based Injection  
- Location: `vulnerable-code/src`  

#### Secure Implementation  
- Implements secure coding practices to prevent SQL Injection:  
  - Server-side input validation  
  - Use of prepared statements  
- Location: `secure-version/src`  

### Requirements  
- **Frontend:** HTML  
- **Backend:** Java EE (Servlets)
- **Server:** Apache Tomcat  
- **Database:** MySQL
